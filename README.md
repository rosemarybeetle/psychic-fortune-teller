<h1> Acknowledgments</h1>
I am not listing their actual code (especially libraries). <br />
See originating clever people's sites for latest versions <br />
Some modified code included <br />

**Twitter4j**

Yusuke Yamamoto (and others I believe?)
Twitter4j is a java library that does the connection and transaction handling between Processing and Twitter.  <br />
This is what enables simple connection to harvest the tweet content, and to send tweets, both from withing the Processing brain. AWESOME. <br />
