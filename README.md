<h1> Acknowledgments</h1>
I am not listing their actual code (especially libraries). <br />
See originating clever people's sites for latest versions <br />
Some modified code included <br />

<h2>Twitter4j</h2>
**Yusuke Yamamoto (and others I believe?)**<br />
Twitter4j is a java library that does the connection and transaction handling between Processing and Twitter.  <br />
This is what enables simple connection to harvest the tweet content, and to send tweets, both from withing the Processing brain. AWESOME. <br />

<h2>GURU text-to-speech</h2>

**Nikolaus Gradwohl**  <br />
The GURU text to speech library for Processing, is a key bit of code.  <br />
It is what allows the Psychic Fortune Teller to talk to you. <br />

<h2>ControlP5</h2>

**Andreas Schlegel**  <br />
ControlP5 is a Processing library used to handle creation and control of user interfaces in the Processing draw() window. <br />
